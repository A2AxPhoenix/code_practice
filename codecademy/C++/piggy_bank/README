                                 PROMPT:
========================================================================
You just returned from a trip to South America. The countries you visited were Colombia, Brazil, and Peru.
You arrived back in your country with some foreign currencies from these three countries.

Write a C++ program called currency.cpp that prompts the user for the amount of each foreign currency.

Your prompts should look like:
    "Enter the number of Colombian Pesos: "
    "Enter the number of Brazilian Reais: "
    "Enter the number of Peruvian Soles: "

Your program should then convert the amount entered by the user and display the total amount of USD.

Your final output should look like:
    "US Dollars: $______"
