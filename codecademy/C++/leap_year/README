========================================================================
Let’s try a challenging problem that will put all your brain cells to the test.

Write a C++ program that:

    1. Takes a year as input.
    2. Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
    3. Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.

There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:

    1. If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, however…
    2. If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
    3. If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
========================================================================
                            LEARNING OUTCOMES:
========================================================================
1. Use of functions in the std::string library (specifically .stoi() and .size())
2. Throwing exceptions using std::stdexcept
3. Using modulus
4. Comparison operators (or, and, greater than, less than, not equal, equal to, and not)
