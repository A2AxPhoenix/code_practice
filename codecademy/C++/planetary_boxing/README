                                PROMPT:
========================================================================
Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts 
for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a C++ program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

    It should ask him what his earth weight is.
    Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
    It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

Here is the table of conversion:
# 	Planet 	    Relative Gravity
1 	Mercury 	    0.38
2 	Venus 	        0.91
3 	Mars 	        0.38
4 	Jupiter 	    2.34
5 	Saturn 	        1.06
6 	Uranus 	        0.92
7 	Neptune 	    1.19
