========================================================================
                            PROMPT:
========================================================================
You may have played Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have you played Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock?
This is the infamous game brought to popularity with the TV show The Big Bang Theory.

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Write a C++ program that:

    1. Prompts the user to select either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
    2. Instructs the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
    3. Compares the user’s choice and the computer’s choice and determine the winner.
    4. Informs the user who the winner is.

Note: This project will be particularly challenging due to its complex logic. Beware! Only the brave should venture forth.

========================================================================
                        Learning Outcomes:
========================================================================
1. Further understanding of conditionals (if/else if/else)
2. Logic operators and logical ordering (and, or, not)
3. Exception handling (using stdexcept)
4. Contemplating edge cases such as ties in this project.
