Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz

    “A thousand years or more ago,
    When I was newly sewn,
    There lived four wizards of renown,
    Whose names are still well known.”

The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry welcomes you! First-year students must go through the annual Sorting Ceremony.

The Sorting Hat is a talking hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to:

    Gryffindor
    Hufflepuff
    Ravenclaw
    Slytherin

Write a C++ program that asks the user some questions and places them into one of the four Houses based on their answers!

                        LEARNING OUTCOMES:
========================================================================
1. Conditional Statements -- if/else if/else
2. Checking input -- if (!cin)
3. Throwing exceptions with stdexcept
4. Manipulate spacing with iomanip (specifically the setw() function)
