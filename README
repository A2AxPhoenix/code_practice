This directory contains all work done on a variety of coding resources. All work will detail what has been completed,
when it was completed, and what resource it was completed on. The code will also be found in the directory of the 
resource I completed it on (i.e. A program completed on CodeWars will be found in /codeWars). This directory will also
contain source code from my time in school. This directory will be updated as work is completed and posted to github
as a portfolio.
